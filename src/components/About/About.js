        A passionate Web Stack Developer who loves to code and do stuff related
        to coding. My motto is "Everything can be learned, coding may not be for
        everyone, but once you put your heart into it, everything is possible"
        It is like solving a puzzle and putting things one piece at a time. A
        straight "A" student in coding bootcamp in University of Arizona. I
        could write clean, organized and well-written design code by using best
        software development practices. A motivated, results-oriented Full Stack
        Developer experienced in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap,
        NodeJs, HandleBars, Mysql, Express, Sequelize, MongoDB, ReactJS,
        Socket-io, Mocha, Chai, Material.io, and React Bootstap among other
        technical languages. Creative, problem-solving and have a can-do
        attitude with a sense of urgency to do what it takes to get things done.
        I find it exciting to develop and design code that reflects the provided
        architecture, design and content elements within the established
        frameworks, specifications and overall environment.
